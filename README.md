We would like to create databases of upcoming local events at 4 different venues in Atlanta: Terminal West, Colony Square, Ponce City Market, and Atlantic Station.

We are doing this by scraping their calendar sites and then converting the necessary information into MongoDB in order to make a table for the next 10 events at each venue.

Venues are assigned as such:

Steve- Terminal West
https://terminalwestatl.com/calendar/

Jerome- Colony Square
https://colonysquare.com/kiosk/events/

Parris- Ponce City Market
https://www.poncecitymarket.com/events

Tatiana- Atlantic Station
https://atlanticstation.com/events/list/
